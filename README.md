## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get AutoLLM running locally on your machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended package manager)
*   A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project
*   An [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) account

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pavun57/autollm
cd autollm
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Set Up Firebase

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable Firestore**: In your new project, go to the "Firestore Database" section and create a database. Start in **production mode**.
3.  **Enable Authentication**: Go to the "Authentication" section, click "Get started", and enable the **Google** provider.
4.  **Get Web App Credentials**:
    *   In your project settings (click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon), scroll down to "Your apps".
    *   Click the "</>" icon to create a new Web App.
    *   Register the app and copy the `firebaseConfig` object values. You'll need these for your environment variables.
5.  **Get Service Account Credentials (for Admin SDK)**:
    *   In your project settings, go to the "Service accounts" tab.
    *   Click "Generate new private key". A JSON file will be downloaded. You'll need values from this file.

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add the following variables.

```env
# Firebase Public (Web App) Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AI...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:...

# Firebase Admin (Service Account) Config
# Get these from the JSON file you downloaded
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="firebase-adminsdk-...@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
# Take the private_key from the JSON, replace \n with \\n
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n...\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n"

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_SIGNIN_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/email-signin
```

**Important**: To format the `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, copy the entire key string from the JSON file and replace every newline character (`\n`) with a literal `\\n`.

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üîß Usage

### Adding Your OpenRouter API Key

AutoLLM uses a "Bring Your Own Key" model. You need to provide your own OpenRouter API key to use the chat.

1.  **Get a Key**: Sign up at [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) and create an API key.
2.  **Add the Key**:
    *   After logging into the app for the first time, a modal will prompt you to enter your key.
    *   You can also add, edit, or remove your key at any time by clicking your user avatar in the top-right corner and selecting "API Key".

Your key is stored securely in your browser's `localStorage` and is **never** saved in the database or sent to any server other than OpenRouter's.
